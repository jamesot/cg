# Defind
Defind uses your Android phone or tablet's camera to look up words and display their definitions. No typing, no menus, no buttons â€” simply hover your device over a word and its definition appears on the screen. Defind is designed to be used with one hand, so you never have to put down your book or magazine.

Built with OpenCV and uses the Wordnik API
